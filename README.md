# Data Structures

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby curriculum.

## Brief overview
The repo contains my implementation of two of the most basic data structures - [Linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20linked,which%20together%20represent%20a%20sequence.) and [Binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), which is just a special kind of [Binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20binary,child%20and%20the%20right%20child.). It includes some of the most common functions, or methods for each data structure, like *adding* a piece of data, *removing* or *searching* for it.

Please note that the ways the methods are implemented are by no means the only ones, or the best ones. There are many ways to do the same thing, and **there's always room for improvement**.
